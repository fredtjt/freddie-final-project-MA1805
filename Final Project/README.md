About The Game

The gameplay is quite simple, you are the sandwich and you must avoid the heavies to survive! 
when a Heavy hits the edge of the screen, you get some survival points, 
seek the highest score you can!


Controls

simply use the arrow keys on your device to move the sandwich
and escape the jaws of the hungry mercenaries.

Theme

The theme is inspired by Team Fortress 2, a first-person shooter I've been playing since 2014. Developed by Valve and led by the legendary Gabe Newell, the game has a special place in gaming history. The Sandwich itself originally appeared in a 2007 trailer for the game, as part of the "Meet the Team" series. Recognizing its comedic potential, the developers decided to add it to the game the following year as a regenerative secondary healing item for the Heavy class.

Aesthetic Style

My choice of aesthetic is influenced by the Flash-based games I played as a kid on sites like Newgrounds. Many of these games were often parodies or spin-offs of popular titles like Halo or Counter-Strike. At the time, I didnâ€™t have a PC powerful enough to run these big-budget games, nor did I own a console. 
So, I turned to quirky website games to fill the gap. Even though Team Fortress 2 is free-to-play, I still enjoy following that same niche genre of late-2000s games that offered entertainment to people like me who couldn't access the high-end games of the era.
